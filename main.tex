% While LaTeX prints out all nice and pretty, most of the time we stare at the PDF on our computer screen
% Therefore, we should have a color scheme and fonts that are easy on the eye on a screen.
% So I took an idea from my programming IDE's and here is Solarized Dark LaTeX

% Created by Christina Lee, christina.lee@gmail.com

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% This allows us to add our colors
\usepackage{xcolor}

%just input either solarized light or dark to change between the colors
%\input{solarizeddark.tex}
\input{solarizedlight.tex}

\section{Introduction}
Isn't this so much easier to read? I know it would kill a printer, but most of the time we don't use a printer.  We just stare at the pdf, then at the raw LaTeX, then at the pdf.  So while we are composing a paper, or a thesis, or just writing up some notes, lets have something nice on the eyes that we just get rid of later.  Happy typing!


\begin{equation}
    a=\frac{1}{2} x
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
    \int f(x)^2 \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation*}

\[
    b=2
\]


\begin{tcolorbox}
\[
f(x)=2
\]
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{align}
f(x)&=\cancelto{0}{x-y+3} \nonumber\\
&=0
\end{align}

\begin{table}
    \centering

    0     & 1   &   0   \\

    0   &   0   &   1
    \end{tabular}
